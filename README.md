# Death-At-Manor-House

This is a repo for a murder mystery game

It is a text-based RPG game written in Python using Kanban methodology. 
To launch the game run the main file in your terminal.

It was a group project of 4 students: Ben Wilde, Daaniel Boateng, Ednaldo Medeiros and myself.

Have fun!!!
